# Python-Assignment-1 TASK 1

This Python program first asks the user to enter two numbers using the input() function. Since input() takes values as text, int() is used to convert them into integers so that mathematical operations can be performed. After taking the numbers, the program calculates their addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division using basic arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /). Each result is stored in a separate variable. Finally, the print() statements display the results of all four operations on the screen in a clear and readable format.

# Python-Assignment-1 TASK 2
This program takes the user’s first name and last name using the input() function. It then joins both names with a space in between to create a full name. Finally, the print() statement uses an f-string to display a friendly greeting message that includes the full name.
